## 5. Storage and Security
Data is stored within Firebase infrastructure (Firestore, Storage, Authentication, Cloud Functions). Access is restricted through Firebase security rules and authentication.

Deleting a project removes related records and files (including photos in Storage). Account deletion is available in the app (Menu > Account > Delete Account) or by contacting the operator if you cannot access the app.

## 6. Sharing With Third Parties
We use third-party providers to run the service:

These providers process data under their own policies as service processors.

Firebase and Expo may process data on servers located outside your country, which can involve cross-border transfers.
